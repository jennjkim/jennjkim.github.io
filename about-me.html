    <p>Hello, my name is Jennifer! I was born and raised in Georgia, but I now spend most of my time between Cornell, where I go to college, and Korea, where my family lives.</p>
    <p>I am majoring in mathematics and minoring in operations research and English. I appreciate mathematics because it has both logic and rigor, yet an aspect of creatively viewing the world (e.g. group homomorphisms) as well. I also enjoy it in conjunction with operations research and data science, especially when I directly see how useful and helpful the latter can be to help others. Finally, Iâ€™ve always liked English and everything to do with reading and writing.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading*, playing the oboe and piano, travel planning, cryptic crosswords, fragrances, ... and much more :)</p>
    <p>*everything from sci-fi to creative nonfiction to poetry, so recommendations are always welcome!</p>
