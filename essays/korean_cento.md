My collection of cento poetry focusing on 20th century Korean poetry. A cento is "a collage-poem composed of lines lifted from other sources" (https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/books/arts/poem-these-fragments-i-have-shored.html). Here I theme my centos around the idea of O
the Korean concept of Osaekchallan. The structure for the piece came as a result of my own interest in color theory and how different world cultures express and view colors.
